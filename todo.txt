Short term goals:
    * Do this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/customizing/#using-a-custom-user-model-when-starting-a-project
    * Read this: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html
    * Add an API app (CRUD + reporting e.g. this-week)
    * Read this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/contenttypes/

Medium term goals:
    * Deploy / host app (AWS probably)
        (Maybe look into bitbucket pipelines / deployments)

Long term goals:
    * Create a standalone JS app that uses the API to reimplement the flexitime django webapp.
