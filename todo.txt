Short term goals:
    * Add type hints + mypy checking (https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/#static-type-checking)
        Other options:
            https://pyre-check.org/
            https://google.github.io/pytype/
            http://mypy-lang.org/
    * Read this: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html
    * Add tests where needed (e.g. services/overtime)
    * Add an API app (CRUD + reporting e.g. this-week)

Medium term goals:
    * Deploy / host app (AWS probably)
        (Maybe look into bitbucket pipelines / deployments)

Long term goals:
    * Create a standalone JS app that uses the API to reimplement the flexitime django webapp.
