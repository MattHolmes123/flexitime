All the Below was done following
https://uwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html#install-uwsgi-system-wide

# Created a virtualenv

# installed uwsgi
pip install uwsgi


# created a test file and ran it like so:
# This tested the following stack: the web client <-> uWSGI <-> Python
uwsgi --http :8000 --wsgi-file test.py


# Tested running flextime using uwsgi
# This tested the following stack: the web client <-> uWSGI <-> Django
uwsgi --http :8000 --module flexitime.wsgi

# Installed nginx, started it, and then went to 127.0.0.1:80 to test it was serving
# This tested the following stack is working: the web client <-> the web server
pacman -S nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Copied down uwsgi_params to the project directory (it can also be found here: /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params)
https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/master/conf/uwsgi_params

# created /etc/nginx/sites-available and sites-enabled and included sites-enabled into /etc/nginx.cong

# tested nginx can communicate with uwsgi
# This tested the following stack is working: the web client <-> the web server <-> the socket <-> uWSGI <-> Python
uwsgi --socket :8001 --wsgi-file test.py

# tested nginx can communite with uwsgi (optionally changing the socket permission)
uwsgi --socket flexitime.sock --wsgi-file test.py --chmod-socket=664


# Running the Django application with uwsgi and nginx
uwsgi --socket flexitime.sock --module flexitime.wsgi --chmod-socket=664

# Running the django application using uwsgi and nginx using an ini file
uwsgi --ini local_deployment/flexitime_uwsgi.ini


# TODO:
Do the following bits in docker:

TO READ LATER:

* If it doesnt work
    You may also have to add your user to nginx’s group (which is probably www-data),
    or vice-versa, so that nginx can read and write to your socket properly.
